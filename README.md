### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

## My name is Joshua Roland but you can call me **Volts, 289volts :zap:**

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ I work with NextJS, Sanity, TailwindCss, Framer-motion, GSAP, Docker, Firebase, MongoDB, NodeJS, APIs.
- I am a buff for accessibility and inclusivity because i believe that the web should be used by 'all' irrespective of the circumstances.
- Because I am concerned about helping my clients get the online visibility and good user experience that they require, I develop pixel perfect designs which are accessible and SEO optimized. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Frontend Projects that are either paid and unpaid. Iâ€™m also looking for paid or unpaid internship opportunities where i can improve on my skills and have real world work experience
